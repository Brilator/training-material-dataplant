## Sections â€“Â Where to place your content?

<style scoped>

.row {display: flex;}
.column {padding: 10px;}

</style>

<div class="row">
  
  <div class="column">


- **Start here**
  - Current best practice for ARC newcomers
  - Includes demo material

- **Guides**
  - specific topic or task
  - do not place specific tools documentation here

- **Core concepts**
  - DataPLANT and ARC core concepts

  </div>

  <div class="column">

  - `<specific-tool>`
    - tools to work with ARCs have their own section
    - e.g. ARCitect, ARC Commander, DataHUB

  - **Fundamentals**
    - Basic RDM topics
    - not necessary ARC-related, but "towards" ARC

# Content metadata (yaml header)

<style scoped>

.column {padding: 10px;}

</style>

<div class="row">
  
  <div class="column" style="font-size: 22px; width:800px">

  - **MUST** start and end with `---`
  - **MUST** contain a `title: `

## Authorship

Every author is listed via a file in [`src/content/authors`](src/content/authors). 

For example `src/content/authors/kevin-frey.yml`:

```yaml
name: Kevin Frey
image: "@images/authors/kevin-frey.jpg"
socials:
  - icon: simple-icons:github
    href: https://github.com/Freymaurer
  - icon: simple-icons:orcid
    href: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8510-6810
affiliation: DataPLANT
```

The author easily be mentioned via yaml metadata

```yaml
authors:
  - kevin-frey
```

---

## Style Guide

- All files and folders must always be [kebap-case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case).
- This means all lower case and `-` as word separator, e.g.

```md
src/assets/images/arc-commander/access-2.png
```

---

## Composition

- Always follow **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle
- If you have the same content in multiple places, consider creating a reusable component, e.g. 
  - "How to register for DataPLANT"
  - "How to create an access token"
  - ...
- Use cross-references (links) to existing content
- In `.mdx` you can also directly insert other content in the current file

---

## Components


<style scoped>

.row {display: flex;}
.column {padding: 10px;}

</style>

<div class="row">
  
  <div class="column">

- **Components** help to style your content
- They are only available in `.mdx` files
- Starlight comes with [built-in components](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/)
- Custom components are available in `src/components/mdx` directory

  </div>

  <div class="column">
  
  - Steps
  - Cards
  - Tabs
  - Mermaid
  - FileTree
  - ViolaSays
  - ...

  </div>

## Component example

```mdx
    <Steps>

    1. Click on the plus icon next to `assays` to add a new assay.
    2. Enter a name for the `New Assay`.

        <ViolaSays>
            SugarMeasurement
        </ViolaSays>

    3. Click `New Assay`.
    4. ARCitect adds the assay `SugarMeasurement` including the folders
    `dataset` and `protocols` as well as a `README.md` and the
    `isa.assay.xlsx` workbook. You can display the file structure created
    by ARCitect by clicking on `SugarMeasurement` as shown below.
    
        <FileTree>
        - assays
            - **SugarMeasurement**
                - dataset
                    - ...
                - protocols
                    - ...
                - isa.assay.xlsx
                - README.md
            - ...
        </FileTree>

        :::note
        The `isa.assay.xlsx` is not displayed inside ARCitect.
        :::
    ...
```

## Images

- Try to use `.svg` files for icons, graphics and logos
- Use any other file format for screenshots or tutorial images
- Images should be stored in the `src/assets/images` directory. If your image has an obvious context, you SHOULD create a subdirectory for it.

```txt
src
|-- assets
    |-- images
        |-- arc-commander
            |-- access-1.png
            |-- access-2.png
            |-- access-3.png
```

---

## Adding images in `.md`/`.mdx`

In markdown you can use the following syntax:

```md
![](@images/path/to/image.png)
```

For html in `.mdx` you can use the following syntax:

```mdx
import MacOSSecurity from "@images/arcitect/macos-security.png"

<img src={MacOSSecurity.src} style="width:50%;display: block; margin: 20px" />
```

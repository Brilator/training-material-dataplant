## About

### Dates and locations

- Monday, Nov 04, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM
  - Location: **Luxemburger Str. 90, 50939 Köln, COPT,** meeting at the entrance
  - Eik Dahms, Vittorio Tracanna
- Monday Nov 11 & Tuesday Nov 12, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM
  - Location: **HHU ZSL 22.07.U1.023**
  - Dominik Brilhaus, Vittorio Tracanna

### Preparation

#### Setup (please prepare this until November 4th)

1. [Sign-up](https://register.nfdi4plants.org/) for a DataHUB user account
:bulb: Add "CEPLAS" as consortium and choose the role "User"
2. Install ARCitect on your laptop following [these instructions](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect/installation/)

#### Interactive exercise (please prepare this until November 11th)

We invite you to a sciebo folder, in which we have prepared one subfolder per participant (named Participant01, Participant02, …). Use this link to join the sciebo folder: <https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/f/967148160>

ArbitraryParticipantID|Participant
-------|-------
Participant01 | 
Participant02 | 
Participant03 | 
Participant04 | 
Participant05 | 
Participant06 | 

2. Please, dump all data into "your folder" that led to the results presented in your BA / MA / PhD thesis - **in the state you left it after finishing your thesis**. No worries, you will not be judged. This is just for training purposes. For example:
   - lab methods
   - materials
   - sample lists
   - protocols
   - measurement data from experiments
   - analyses
   - scripts
   - ...
4. Do not share the thesis itself (i.e. the text document).
5. Keep the overall size of your folder below 300 MB. For data files larger than 50MB (e.g. sequencing or imaging data) please prepare simple placeholders. To do so, just open a text editor (not Word) and store blank files  - e.g. store a “sample01.fastq” as a placeholder for a 5 GB sequencing file called sample01.fastq. If you have too many files, do this only for a representative subset.

##### Data sharing agreement

All participants invited to the shared folder consent to the following:

No data may be downloaded, copied or shared with third parties outside this course.
All data downloaded for the purpose of the exercise below will be deleted immediately after the course.

:warning: Do not share sensitive or personal data
:warning: Do not share data that might fall under intellectual property or patent rights

## Day 1

### Getting started guide

<https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/start-here/>

### Feedback – Day 1

...was too short | I'm happy with... | I did not like at all ...| This idea or advice was good: ... | I really liked ...  
---|---|---|---|---
how to actually organize own experiment | different RDM needs adressed, tutorial| my RDM habits | a lot of info about FAIR, accessbility, databases | solution for structured data
:coffee: break  | learning ARC(itect) will save me | :) | think first, structure second; get started early; RDM does not hurt | there is a way b/t private chaos and PI-ready handover

## Day 2

### Validate & publish you ARC

- [Validate](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/guides/validate-arc/)
- [Publish](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/guides/publish-arc/)

### Recap points

- manually editing files
  - e.g. study / assay names
- demo [ARC Commander](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arc-commander/)
- you can drop any files and folders besides "ARC" folders
- metadata registry / [ARC search](https://arcregistry.nfdi4plants.org/isasearch)
- [VSCode plugin](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/guides/vs-code-extension/)
- [commit / sync recommendations](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/git/git-syncing-recommendation/)
- [large file storage (LFS)](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/git/git-lfs/)
- banners in PlantHUB [ignore them](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/vault/faqs/#datahub)

### Feedback – Day 2

...was too short | I'm happy with... | I did not like at all ...| This idea or advice was good: ... | I really liked ...
---|---|---|---|---
show an actual example | (extremely happy) to have this prior to experiments | Some ARCitect non-functionality  |  big generic repositories (e.g. zenodo) have limited reusability | tutors' enthusiasm

## Issues & Bugs & Suggestions

### Swate

> Moved comments here: <https://github.com/nfdi4plants/Swate/issues>

### ARCitect

- make the side bars collapsable to get a better full view -> let the login, etc stuff be hidden

> That's available under "settings" -> thank youuu

<https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCitect/issues/>

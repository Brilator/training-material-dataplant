## ARCs come with their own wiki space

<div class="two-columns">

<div style="font-size: 27px">

- directly associated to your ARC
- same access rights as your ARC
- share meeting minutes or ideas with collaboration partners
- keep ARC clean of files that are not considered "research data"

# Namespaces

- Every user has a personal namespace, where they can upload or create new ARCs
- Every group and subgroup has its own namespace

<div class="table-container" style="font-size: 25px">

Type | URL | Namespace | Name
--- | --- | --- | --- 
A **personal** ARC | https://git.nfdi4plants.org/brilator/Facultative-CAM-in-Talinum | `brilator` | Dominik Brilhaus
An **group**-shared ARC | https://git.nfdi4plants.org/hhu-plant-biochemistry/Samuilov-2018-BOU-PSP | `hhu-plant-biochemistry` | HHU Plant Biochemistry

</div>

:bulb: **Personal** is not the same as **private**

# Visibility

The visibility of ARCs and groups can be managed individually for each ARC or group

# Permissions & Roles

When inviting new members to an ARC or group, you can choose between different levels.

## Choosing the proper role

When inviting new members to an ARC or group, you can choose between different levels.

<img src="/images-tm/arc-sharing-permissionsroles.drawio.svg" width="800px">

ðŸ’¡ By default you are **Owner** of an ARC you create or upload to the DataHUB.

---
layout: default
---

## **Projects** and **Groups** are not the same

- "Project" = ARC
- "Groups" = Group of users

## **Projects** and **Groups** are not the same

- "Project" = ARC
- "Groups" = Group of users

## Project = ARC

- In the DataHUB, ARCs are called "projects"; they are the same.
- An ARC can be shared with individual users (invited as "members") or a group.

---
layout: default
---

## DataHUB Groups = Group of members (e.g. lab)

- A "Group" is a group of users with specific [permissions](#roles-and-permissions)
- A group can share ARCs
- A group can be invited to an ARC
- Groups can have subgroups

## Namespaces

- Every user has a personal namespace, where they can upload or create new ARCs
- Every group and subgroup has its own namespace

<div>

  Type |Â URL | Namespace | Name
  ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ 
  A **personal** ARC | https://git.nfdi4plants.org/brilator/Facultative-CAM-in-Talinum | `brilator` | Dominik Brilhaus
  An **group**-shared ARC | https://git.nfdi4plants.org/hhu-plant-biochemistry/Samuilov-2018-BOU-PSP |Â `hhu-plant-biochemistry` | HHU Plant Biochemistry

## Visibility

The visibility of ARCs and groups can be managed individually for each ARC or group

ðŸ’¡ By default every ARC and every group is set to **private**.

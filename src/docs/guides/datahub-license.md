## Why are licenses important

Licenses in projects and repositories are essential for defining how others can use, modify, and distribute the code or content within that project. When you create an ARC and make it public, it automatically implies that others can see the content, but without a license, the legal permissions are unclear. A license provides a formal framework that protects the creatorâ€™s rights while also clarifying the terms of use for the content. For example, some licenses allow free use and modification with few restrictions (like MIT or Apache 2.0), while others may require derivative works to also be open source (such as the GPL). Therefore, a license is crucial for fostering collaboration while ensuring legal protection and clarity for both creators and users.

## Adding a `LICENSE` to your ARC

To add a `LICENSE`, navigate to your ARC in DataHUB and click on "Add LICENSE" on the right sidebar menu(1).

:bulb: We recommend to focus on open access / CC-BY publications and datasets, unless you explicitly know, whether and how to re-use the data published elsewhere. See e.g. https://git.nfdi4plants.org/brilator/Facultative-CAM-in-Talinum/-/blob/main/LICENSE for a CC-BY 4.0 license

:warning: Don't forget to sync your local ARC (via ARC Commander or ARCitect) after creating a `LICENSE` file in DataHUB.
